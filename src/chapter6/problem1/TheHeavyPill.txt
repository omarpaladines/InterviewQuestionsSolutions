Initial Idea (not actually correct):
We count the number of pills in each bottle. If there are n_i pills in bottle i, then the total weight of the pills in
the ith bottle is n_i grams if the bottle is normal and 1.1n_i if the bottle is the heavy one. With this in mind, we can
count the number of pills of each bottle. We then put all the pills in the scale and compare the total weight to each of
the numbers: 1.1n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k, n_1 + 1.1n_2 + ... + n_k, ... , n_1 + n_2 + ... + 1.1n_k. Note that because there
is exactly one heavy bottle, the total weight must match at least one of these k numbers (these are all the possibilities
for the total weight). This raises the obvious question: Can the total weight match two (or more) of these numbers?
If this were the case, then this procedure wouldn't work.

Lets suppose this happens for bottles i and j. That is,
n_1 + n_2 + ... + 1.1n_i + ... + n_k = n_1 + n_2 + ... + 1.1n_j + ... + n_k.
<=> 0.1n_i = 0.1n_j
<=> n_i = n_j.

Thus, if two bottles have the same number of pills, it doesnt matter where the heavy pill is, these two combinations
will yield the same number. What can we do in that case? I do not think we can do it with one weighing if thats the case.
