The solution the book and I proposed is clearly not O(logN) as binary search. In fact it is O(N). How much better is this
solution than doing linear search then? It takes O(logN) when there are no empty strings whereas linear search takes
O(N). So it is indeed an improvement under some inputs.

There were a lot of implementation problems with the indices I realized when testing. Should be aware of this fact in
sorting and searching. Test by hand a lot of small test cases and double and triple check the indices.
