First of all, the problem is not really well specified. I did not realize that the function was supposed to be in the
context of a board. I thought that the function just took a piece and a position without taking into account the other
pieces. Anyways, this is easy to modify by just checking if there is a piece at the position.

We need to test for normal cases, boundary cases and strange inputs.

Normal cases: Test for positions completely inside the board.

Boundary Cases: Test for all 4 corners and positions right in the walls of the board.

Strange inputs: Test for negative coordinates and > 64 coordinates. Test for exactly one of them out of bounds and when
both of them out of bounds. Should clarify if need an exception to be thrown, or an error message, etc to test accordingly.
