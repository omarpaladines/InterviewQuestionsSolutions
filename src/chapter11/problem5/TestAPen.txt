This problem is really about asking questions and then going from there. You should ask:

1. Who and why are they going to use it.
2. How will they use it (use cases).
3. What are the bounds of it uses (how long is it supposed to last, temperature, etc for example).
4. What should happen if it fails?

Given this answers you can start defining normal cases, intended uses and unintended uses.
